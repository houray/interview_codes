Total Accepted: 135681 Total Submissions: 625062 Difficulty: Medium
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.

Note:
Should declare a variable 'curr_substr' to note the current substring length.

Solution:

Declare a hash table h. Keyed by char valued by position;
max_substr := 0;
curr_substr := 0;
FOR (char i = first : last)
  IF h.has(s[i]) AND i - h[s[i]] <= curr_substr, THEN
    curr_substr := i - h[s[i]];
  ELSE
    ++max_substr;
  END IF
  h[s[i]] := i;
  max_substr := max(max_substr, curr_substr);
END FOR;
